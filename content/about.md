Hi, I'm Connor.

I study computer science at the University of Michigan with plans to graduate with a BSE in August 2024.

I've acquired experience across various software development domains, including front-end, back-end, cloud, and game development.

Going forward, I plan to study abroad in France to diversify my cultural experience and gain a broader perspective on global tech trends and methodologies.
