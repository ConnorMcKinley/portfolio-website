By utilizing AWS services, I created a serverless portfolio website, hosted on S3 with the domain managed by Route 53. The site, built using Hugo and written in Markdown, is deployed through GitHub Actions, with content stored in a GitHub repository. This structure results in a website that is not only easy to maintain and update but also scalable and capable of handling significant traffic.

In addition to these technical aspects, I enhanced the website's visual appeal by incorporating custom graphics generated with DALL-E. This innovative AI tool enabled me to create unique, eye-catching images tailored to the site's aesthetic, including my profile picture. The use of DALL-E's advanced capabilities demonstrates my commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a visually stunning and functionally robust online presence.
