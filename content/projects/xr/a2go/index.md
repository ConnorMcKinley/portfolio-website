A2-Go is an engaging augmented reality game that combines exploration and interaction in a unique virtual experience set in Ann Arbor. The game features a dynamic camera system that follows the player’s avatar, providing an overhead view and revealing new areas as the player explores. Landmarks play a pivotal role, with players tapping on them to unlock trivia and new seed types, each corresponding to real-world Ann Arbor locations. The game seamlessly transitions between two main modes - exploration and interaction - via an easily accessible button, each mode enriched with its own musical theme.

A key aspect of A2-Go is its interactive UI, including a scrollable inventory bar and a clear display of the player’s currency. Players engage in planting various types of trees, which not only differ aesthetically but also in the revenue they generate. The growth of these trees is visualized differently in each mode, adding depth to the gameplay. The inclusion of a seed shop allows players to purchase different seed types, using the game’s currency system, with some seeds unlocked through landmark exploration.

The game also boasts intuitive camera controls in exploration mode, allowing players to adjust their view of the avatar and the world. One of the most notable features of A2-Go is the introduction of retro-pokemon style turn-based battles against squirrels, adding an exciting strategic layer to the game. Additionally, the player is represented by a customizable humanoid avatar, enhancing the immersive experience with smooth animations and movement.

A2-Go stands out for its creative blend of real-world exploration, interactive gaming, and educational elements. Its unique battle feature and engaging gameplay offer a memorable experience that encourages players to interact with their environment in innovative ways.
