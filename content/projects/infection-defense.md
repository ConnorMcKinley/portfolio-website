At Auxin Games, I was at the forefront of developing 'Infection Defense', a game designed to educate students about the complexities of the immune system. I was instrumental in enhancing the gameplay experience, introducing a refined user interface, intuitive controls, an overhauled particle system, and innovative character behaviors. Furthermore, with an eye towards the future and team scalability, I meticulously documented 70% of the codebase, ensuring a seamless transition for incoming developers.

The following video was recorded after my changes were implemented into the official game.

In the following video demonstration, I showcase a feature that I developed to highlight UI and non-UI elements. This feature was intended to be used during in-game tutorials to focus the users attention to what was being described. It employs a novel procedural approach that uses the bounds of an object to cut out holes in a transparent texture. This feature was instrumental to the rapid development of the updated tutorials.

In the next video, I demonstrate an out of bounds feature that I designed. Specifically, it notifies the player that they cannot place the unit at the location that they provided. This feature allows artists to form the boundaries to any map shape.

At Auxin Games, I played a pivotal role in shaping the behavior and design of unit types, namely the T Cell and & B Cell. I presented my ideas and concepts through this video to the lead developer, and I was pleased to see many of my proposed designs were incorporated into the official game within just a few weeks.
