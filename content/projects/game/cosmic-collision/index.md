In my journey through game development, I took my first stride with "Cosmic Collision," a puzzle game developed during my High School Game Design course. This game, my inaugural attempt using Unity, immerses players in a sci-fi environment where they utilize gravity to annihilate enemy planets, offering a variety of challenges and intriguing gameplay mechanics.

Cosmic Collision served as a creative canvas where I designed numerous game assets, delving into the basics of models, textures, and shaders, laying down the foundational blocks of my understanding of game development. The creation of each asset was a step towards mastering the details of game design, enriching my knowledge and shaping my skills in Unity.

This venture was more than just a class project; it was the genesis of my exploration into game development, a practical endeavor where I could combine creativity with technology, learning the nuances of Unity and game design. Cosmic Collision was a stepping stone, enhancing my grasp on game development basics and fueling my passion to create more immersive and innovative gaming experiences.
