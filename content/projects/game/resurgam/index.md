In 2021, I started the development of a unique survival sandbox game set in a world centuries after a successful alien invasion. The project stands out with its innovative game mechanics.

The technical foundation of the game is built on algorithms such as Dual Contour and Octrees. These algorithms are used to procedurally generate the terrain, which is then populated with flora and fauna. The game also features a dynamic weather system.

During this journey, I meticulously designed and crafted every asset, utilizing Blender and Substance apps, to create realistic and immersive environments. Agile workflow strategies were implemented to facilitate rapid asset development, deployment, and integration, ensuring a smooth and iterative development process.

The game continues to evolve, and I am excited to share more details in the future.
