While at Amway, I spearheaded the development of a Python Package Index hosted on AWS infrastructure, aimed at fostering collaboration between various cloud teams. This initiative was crucial in providing a centralized platform for efficient package management and sharing, thereby optimizing workflow and enhancing overall productivity among the teams.

I utilized AWS CloudFormation to facilitate a streamlined deployment processes as well as version control. These enhancements were pivotal in maintaining consistency and reliability within the cloud environments, allowing for a more integrated and coordinated approach to cloud-based project development.

Below are the infrastructure diagrams for the Python Package Index:
