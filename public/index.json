Developed using Unity and incorporating OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s Whisper API, this educational game immerses players in various thematic worlds such as space, dinosaurs, and chemistry. Each map contains a unique word bank, and correct pronunciation of words animates objects in an engaging way.\nThe project began with the challenge of adapting Unity for VR functionalities and progressed to creating a welcoming, cartoon-style village scene as the main hub. Here, players are guided by the mascot Quacky through interactive tutorials. The space-themed map allows players to revive planets by naming them correctly, adding a fun, educational twist.\nAs development progressed, the team focused on user experience enhancements, such as improving visual clarity, refining UIs, and introducing audio elements for pronunciation help. A farm scene was added, featuring common animals and crops, further expanding the learning environment.\nFinal refinements were made to ensure a seamless, immersive experience, including completing the farm map, adding NPC interactions, and creating side quests. The user-friendly landing page, realistic ambient sounds, and a comprehensive tutorial with Quacky\u0026rsquo;s voiceover round out the user experience.\nThe project culminated in the creation of a promotional trailer and a polished website. \u0026ldquo;Vocab Village\u0026rdquo; stands out for its combination of educational value and technological innovation, leveraging the capabilities of Unity and the advanced speech recognition of OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s Whisper to create a unique VR learning experience.\nVocab Village # ","date":"December 2023","permalink":"/projects/xr/vocab-village/","section":"Projects","summary":"VR application designed to enhance vocabulary learning for middle school and ESL high school students.","title":"Vocab Village"},{"content":"","date":"December 2023","permalink":"/tags/vr/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"VR"},{"content":"A2-Go is an engaging augmented reality game that combines exploration and interaction in a unique virtual experience set in Ann Arbor. The game features a dynamic camera system that follows the player’s avatar, providing an overhead view and revealing new areas as the player explores. Landmarks play a pivotal role, with players tapping on them to unlock trivia and new seed types, each corresponding to real-world Ann Arbor locations. The game seamlessly transitions between two main modes - exploration and interaction - via an easily accessible button, each mode enriched with its own musical theme.\nA key aspect of A2-Go is its interactive UI, including a scrollable inventory bar and a clear display of the player’s currency. Players engage in planting various types of trees, which not only differ aesthetically but also in the revenue they generate. The growth of these trees is visualized differently in each mode, adding depth to the gameplay. The inclusion of a seed shop allows players to purchase different seed types, using the game’s currency system, with some seeds unlocked through landmark exploration.\nThe game also boasts intuitive camera controls in exploration mode, allowing players to adjust their view of the avatar and the world. One of the most notable features of A2-Go is the introduction of retro-pokemon style turn-based battles against squirrels, adding an exciting strategic layer to the game.
