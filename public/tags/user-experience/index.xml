      <description>By utilizing Figma, I created a Figma prototype for an app designed to encourage students to explore the campus more extensively. This app assigns quests to students, directing them to visit specific landmarks, thus promoting exploration and interaction with the campus environment.
Later on, I was given the opportunity to collaborate with other students and design a prototype for a user-centric application focused on aiding students in exploring and determining their career pathways.</description>
