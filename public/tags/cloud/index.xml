      <description>By utilizing AWS services, I was able to create a serverless portfolio website. The website is hosted on S3, and the domain is managed by Route 53. The website is built using Hugo, and the content is written in Markdown. The website is deployed using GitHub Actions, and the content is stored in a GitHub repository.
The result is a website that is easy to maintain and update. The website is also easily scalable, and can handle large amounts of traffic.</description>

      <description>While at Amway, I spearheaded the development of a Python Package Index hosted on AWS infrastructure, aimed at fostering collaboration between various cloud teams. This initiative was crucial in providing a centralized platform for efficient package management and sharing, thereby optimizing workflow and enhancing overall productivity among the teams.
I utilized AWS CloudFormation to facilitate a streamlined deployment processes as well as version control. These enhancements were pivotal in maintaining consistency and reliability within the cloud environments, allowing for a more integrated and coordinated approach to cloud-based project development.</description>
