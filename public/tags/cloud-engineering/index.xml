      <description>After my time working as a cloud engineer, I set out to create a beginner-friendly video demo to show how to host a static website using AWS. This project was all about breaking down the process into simple, understandable steps, making AWS technology approachable for everyone, even those new to it. By producing this easy-to-follow introductory video, I hoped to bridge the gap between complex hosting solutions and beginners looking to learn and understand the technology.</description>

      <description>Embarking on a journey to blend nostalgia with technology, I leveraged the power of Unreal Engine to craft a virtual reality experience, the &amp;ldquo;CSE Simulator.&amp;rdquo; This project creates a virtual version of our university&amp;rsquo;s computer lab that was set to be shut down, keeping its memory alive. The simulator lets users explore and interact with the lab as if they were really there, making it a digital memory for everyone who spent time in it.</description>
